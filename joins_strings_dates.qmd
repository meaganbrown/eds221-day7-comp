## Joins 

```{r}
animals <- tibble::tribble(
  ~location,   ~species,  ~maturity,
  "lagoon",   "bobcat",    "adult",
   "bluff",   "coyote", "juvenile",
   "creek",      "fox",    "adult",
    "oaks", "squirrel", "juvenile",
   "bluff",   "bobcat",    "adult"
  )

sites <- tibble::tribble(
  ~location,      ~full_site_name, ~jurisdiction,
    "beach",       "Goleta Beach",     "SB City",
   "lagoon",        "UCSB Lagoon",        "UCSB",
    "bluff",       "Ellwood Mesa",     "SB City",
     "oaks", "Fremont Campground",        "USFS"
  )

```

### Full Join

```{r}
full_join_example <- full_join(animals, sites, 
                               by = "location")
```

### Left Join

```{r}
left_join_example <- left_join(animals, sites,
                               by = "location")
```

### Inner Join

```{r}
# Only joins what the data sets have in common
inner_join_example <- inner_join(animals, sites,
                                 by = "location")
```

```{r}
sites_2 <- sites %>% 
  rename(loc = location)
```

```{r}
#Example of joining with non matching names

nonmatching <- full_join(animals,
                         sites_2,
                         by = c("location" = "loc"))
```

### Semi Join

```{r}
semi_join_example <- semi_join(animals, sites,
                               by = "location")
```

### Anti Join

```{r}
#Only retains rows if they don't have a match
anti_join_example <- anti_join(animals, sites,
                               by = "location")
```

## Wrangling Refresher

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
```

```{r}
# Only include penguins at Biscoe and Dream islands
penguins_wrangled <- penguins %>% 
  filter(island %in% c("Biscoe",
                       "Dream")) %>% 
# Remove the year and sex variables
 select(-year, -sex) %>% 
# Add a new column called body_mass_kg, with penguin mass converted from grams to kilograms
  mutate(body_mass_kg = body_mass_g / 1000) %>% 
  # Rename the island variable to location
  rename("location" = island)
  
```
